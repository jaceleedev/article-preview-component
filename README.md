## My process

### Built with

- Next.js (v14.2.5)
- TypeScript (v5)
- Tailwind CSS (v3.4.1)
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid, Flexbox
- SEO & web accessibility

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights and improved my skills in several areas:

1. From this project onwards, logic requiring the use of state was introduced, and it was exciting to create the ShareBar functionality by appropriately utilizing useState. I was particularly pleased with how smoothly I implemented the ShareBar, which had slightly different appearances in mobile and desktop views.

2. I learned for the first time during this project that the tag is used to implement modal dialog boxes (pop-up windows). It's much better than using both functionally and in terms of accessibility. I think I'll use it often when creating modals in the future.

These learnings have not only improved my technical skills but also given me a clearer direction for future growth and areas to focus on in upcoming projects.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on and improving in these areas:

I will be taking on increasingly complex projects, and I want to write better code by considering system design from a front-end perspective. This is not a short-term task. Regardless of the project I undertake, the more I think about it, the more it will help me grow.

By focusing on these areas, I hope to continually improve my front-end development skills and create more efficient and sophisticated web applications.
